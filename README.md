## Description

"Beats per Minute" is an interactive full stack web-application concept which has been designed to help users keep track of and achieve their health and fitness goals. The web application allows the user to create a personal account and keep a record of workout and diet plans that suit their needs. 

This group project was completed in order to demonstrate the ability to utilise front-end and back-end technologies to build a full-stack web-application. Some of the technologies include CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Handlebars, NodeJS, mySQL and Sequelize (a full list of technologies used can be found below),

Completing the project also allowed for first-hand experience of collaboration in the development of full-stack applications. While there were many successes, the group discovered that there can be many challenges when collaborating with other developers. The process followed whilst completing the project highlighted the various approaches that can be taken to ensure that any problems or challenges that arise can be resolved effectively.
